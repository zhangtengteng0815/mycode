CONTRIBUTING TO OPENVPN-BUILD
=============================

The suggested way to contribute is to fork the repo and issue a pull request on 
GitHub. Alternatively you can send your patch to openvpn-devel mailing list:

- https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/openvpn-devel

The subject line should look like this:

  [PATCH: openvpn-build] summary of the patch

To avoid merging issues patches should be created with git-format-patch or sent 
using git-send-email. The easiest way to add the subject line prefix is to use 
this option:

  --subject-prefix='PATCH: openvpn-build'

Please try to split large patches into small, atomic pieces to make reviews 
easier.

If you want quick feedback on a patch, you can visit the #openvpn-devel channel 
on Freenode. Note that you need to be logged in to join the channel:
